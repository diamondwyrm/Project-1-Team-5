## An Analysis of the Factors that Impact Housing Costs in the US
By Kim Harrison, Kent Hazen, Tim Tang & Laura De Morneau

### Background
Our goal is to analyze various datasets to look into what factor can impact housing prices in the US.  We will consider:
* Does it make more financial sense to rent or buy in a given city?
* How do demographics impact housing prices?
* Does the frequency of severe weather events in a given city impact housing prices?
* How does the layout of a house (number of bedrooms/bathrooms) impact the house prices?

### Data Sources
We culled data from the following sources:
* Zillow (Housing prices, amenities)
* US Census (Demographic information, population data)
* FEMA (Severe weather events)

### Technical Skills
* Python / Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Plotly Express
* Seaborn
